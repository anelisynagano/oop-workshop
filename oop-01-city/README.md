## Cities

0. - Create a `city.js` file

1. - Create a City class
A city must have a _name_, _country_ and _population_ - in this order!
(check wikipedia if you want accurate populations)

2. - Create two instances of City
e.g:
Lisbon, Portugal, '505,526'
Paris, France, '2,140,526'

3. - Create a method printInfo()
This method should show all properties of the city like:
'Lisbon is a city in Portugal that has 505,526 inhabitants.'

note1: do NOT put console.log in the methods, use console log when you call the method
